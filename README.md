# Ansys-Mechanical---Rocket Enginne Bolted-Nozzle-Flange - Nonlinear FEA

This project focuses on the **nonlinear finite element analysis of a bolted nozzle flange**.  
It was carried out as part of the Cornell University edX course on **Finite Element Analysis**.

## 📑 Project Description
- Modeled and analyzed a **rocket nozzle exhaust flange** under nonlinear loading conditions.  
- Used **ANSYS Mechanical** for geometry setup, meshing, and nonlinear solution steps.  
- Documented all **equations, theory, and methodology** in detail.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`3.1 Bolted Nozzle Flange.pdf`** → Complete notes with **procedure, derivations, images, and detailed learnings**.  
- **`Bolted Nozzle Flange.wbpz`** → ANSYS Workbench archive file (geometry + setup).  
  ⚠️ *This archive does not include the result files to keep the repo size small.*
